\section{Overview}

The biggest open problem in edge-coloring is the Goldberg--Seymour conjecture.
Over the past two decades, the main tool for attacking this problem has become
Tashkinov trees, a vast generalization of Vizing fans and Kierstead paths.
The second author proved that if $G$ is a line graph, then $\chi(G)\le
\max\{\omega(G),\frac{7\Delta(G)+10}{8}\}$.  In the same paper, he conjectured
that $\chi(G)\le \max\{\omega(G),\frac{5\Delta(G)+8}{6}\}$, which is best possible.
We call the latter inequality the $\frac56$-Conjecture, and in this paper we prove
it.  Along the way, we develop more general techniques and results that will
likely be of independent interest, due to their use in approaching the
Goldberg--Seymour conjecture.

A graph $G$ is \emph{elementary} if $\chi'(G)=\W(G)$; such graphs satisfy the
Goldberg--Seymour Conjecture.  (We begin by proving that every minimal
counterexample to the $\frac56$-Conjecture is elementary.  In Section 3, we conclude
by also proving that every elementary graph satisfies the $\frac56$-conjecture.)  A
\emph{defective color}
for a Tashkinov tree $T$ is a color used on more than one edge from $V(T)$ to
$V(G)-V(T)$; a Tashkinov tree is \emph{strongly closed} if it has no defective
color.  Andersen[] and Goldberg[] showed that if $G$ is critical, then $G$ is
elementary if there exists $e\in E(G)$ and $X\subseteq V(G)$ and a
$k$-edge-coloring $\vph$ of $G-e$ such that $X$ contains the endpoints of $e$
and $X$ is elementary and strongly closed w.r.t.$\vph$.  Thus, to show that $G$
is elementary, it suffices to show that if $G$ is $(k+1)$-critical, then there
exists an edge $e\in E(G)$ and a $k$-coloring $\vph$ of $G-e$ such that some
maximal Tashkinov tree containing $e$ is strongly closed.  The following
definition is useful.  
A vertex $v \in V(G)$ is \emph{special} if every Vizing fan rooted at $v$ (taken over all
$k$-colorings of $G-e$, over all edges $e$ incident to $v$) has at most 3 vertices,
including $v$.
As a warmup, in Section 2 we prove that if $\chi'(G)\ge \Delta(G)+2$ and every
vertex of $G$ is special, then $G$ is elementary, i.e., $\chi'(G)=\W(G)$.  Next,
we push our methods further, allowing our maximal Tashkinov tree to have at most
3 non-special vertices.

In Section 3, we show that if $G$ is a minimal counterexample to the
$\frac56$-Conjecture, then every non-special vertex $v$ has
$d_G(v)<\frac34\Delta(G)$.  Since every maximal Tashkinov tree $T$ is
elementary, and every non-special vertex misses more than $k/4$ colors, we
conclude that $T$ has at most 3 non-special vertices.  Thus our results from
Section 2 apply.  As a consequence, every minimal countexample to the
$\frac56$-Conjecture is elementary.  To complete the proof of the $\frac56$-conjecture,
we prove that it follows from the Goldberg--Seymour Conjecture.  More precisely,
we show for each graph $G$ that if $\chi'(G)=\W(G)$, then
$\chi'(G)\le\max\{\omega(G),\frac{5\Delta(G)+8}6\}$.


Graphs can have multiple edges.

\section{Tashkinov Trees}
We use the following notation.  A graph $G$ is \emph{critical} if $\chi'(G-e) < \chi'(G)$ for all $e \in E(G)$. 
 
Let $G$ be a critical graph with $\chi'(G) = k+1$ for an integer $k \ge \Delta(G) + 1$. 
Let $\varphi$ be a $k$-edge-coloring of $G - e_0$ for some $e_0 \in E(G)$.  For each vertex $v\in V(G)$, let $\varphi(v)$ be the
set of colors used in $\vph$ on edges incident to $v$ and let
$\vphn(v)=[k]\setminus \vph(v)$. A \emph{Tashkinov tree} with respect to $\varphi$ is a sequence $v_0, e_1, v_1, e_2,\ldots, v_{t-1},e_t,v_t$ such that all
$v_i$ are distinct, $e_i=v_jv_i$ and $\vph(e_i)\in \vphn(v_\ell)$ for some $j$ and $\ell$ with $0\le j< i$
and $0\le \ell < i$.

For $v \in V(G)$ and colors $\alpha, \beta$, let $P_v(\alpha, \beta)$ be the subgraph of $G$ containing $v$ induced on the edges with color $\alpha$ or $\beta$.  
Then $P_v(\alpha, \beta)$ is a path or a cycle.

A \emph{defective color} for a Tashkinov tree $T$ in $G$ is a color used on more than one edge
from $V(T)$ to $V(G) \setminus V(T)$.  Let $t(G)$ be the maximum size of a Tashkinov tree over all $e \in E(G)$
and all $k$-edge-colorings $\vph$ of $G - e$.  Let $\T(G)$ be the set of all triples $(T,e,\vph)$ such that $e \in E(G)$, $\vph$ is a $k$-edge-coloring of $G-e$ and
$T$ is a Tashkinov tree with respect to $e$ and $\vph$ with $|T| = t(G)$.  Notice that, by definition, we have $\T(G) \ne \emptyset$.

Recall that for a $k$-edge-coloring $\vph$ of $G-e$, a maximal Tashkinov tree
starting with $e$ may not be unique.  However, if $T_1$ and $T_2$ are both such
trees, then it is easy to show that $V(T_1)\subseteq V(T_2)$; by symmetry, also
$V(T_2)\subseteq V(T_1)$, so $V(T_1)=V(T_2)$.

TODO: NEED DEFINITION OF ELEMENTARY SET, ELEMENTARY GRAPH.  NEED TO STATE LEMMA THAT TASHKINOV TREES ARE ELEMENTARY, ALSO THAT MAXIMUM SIZE TASHKINOV TREE WITHOUT DEFECTIVE COLORS IMPLIES G IS ELEMENTARY.

\begin{lem}\label{FreeColorsLemma}
Let $G$ be a non-elementary critical graph with $\chi'(G) = k+1$ for an integer $k \ge \Delta(G) + 1$.
If $(T, v_0v_1, \vph) \in \T(G)$ for $v_0v_1 \in E(G)$, then for every $\alpha \in \vphn(v_0)$ and $\beta \in \vphn(v_1)$ we have $V\parens{P_{v_1}(\alpha, \beta)} \subsetneq V(T)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose we have $(T, v_0v_1, \vph) \in \T(G)$ for $v_0v_1 \in E(G)$ and $\alpha \in \vphn(v_0)$ and $\beta \in \vphn(v_1)$ such that $V\parens{P_{v_1}(\alpha, \beta)} = V(T)$.
Put $P = P_{v_1}(\alpha, \beta)$.  Since $G$ is non-elementary, $T$ has a defective color $\delta$ with respect to $\vph$. Let $\tau$ be
missing at $v_2$. Let $Q = P_{v_2}(\tau, \delta)$.
Since $P$ is maximal, $\delta$ is not missing at any vertex of $P$;
since $V(P)$ is elementary, $\tau$ is not missing at any vertex of $P$ other 
than $v_2$.  As a result, $Q$ ends outside $V(P)$.  Now $Q$ could leave
$V(T)$ and re-enter it repeatedly, but $Q$ ends outside $V(P)$, so there is a last vertex $w \in V(Q) \cap V(P)$;
say $Q$ ends at $z \in V(G)\setminus V(P)$.  Let $\pi \notin \{\alpha, \beta\}$ be a
color missing at $w$.  Since
$P$ is maximal, no edge colored $\tau$ or $\pi$ leaves $V(P)$.  So, we can
swap $\tau$ and $\pi$ on every edge in $G - V(P)$ without changing the fact that
$P$ is a maximum size Tashkinov tree.  Now swap $\delta$ and $\pi$ on the
subpath of $Q$ from $w$ to $z$;
since $\pi$ is missing at $w$, the $\delta-\pi$ path does end at $w$.  Now
$\delta$ is missing at $w$, but $\delta$ was defective in $\vph$, so there are
still edges colored $\delta$ leaving $V(P)$, adding such an edge gets a larger
Tashkinov tree, a contradiction.
\end{proof}


\section{Special vertices}
TODO: DEFINE SPECIAL.

Let $\nu(T)$ be the number of non-special vertices in $T$.
\begin{lem}\label{SpecialPath}
Let $G$ be a critical graph with $\chi'(G) = k+1$ for an integer $k \ge \Delta(G) + 1$.
Let $\vph$ be a $k$-edge-coloring of $G-v_0v_1$.  Suppose $\alpha \in \vphn(v_0)$ and $\beta \in \vphn(v_1)$.  
Let $P = v_1v_2\cdots v_r$ be an $\alpha-\beta$ path
with edges $e_i = v_iv_{i+1}$ for $1 \le i \le r-1$.  If $v_i$ is special for
all odd $i$, then for any $\tau \in \vphn(v_0)$ there are edges $f_i =
v_iv_{i+1}$ for $1 \le i \le r-1$ such that $f_i = e_i$ for $i$ even and
$\vph(f_i) = \tau$ for $i$ odd.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose not and choose a counterexample minimizing $r$.  By minimality of
$r$, we have $\vph(v_{r-1}v_r) = \alpha$ and we have $f_i = v_iv_{i+1}$ for
$1 \le i \le r-2$ such that $f_i = e_i$ for $i$ even and $\vph(f_i) = \tau$ for
$i$ odd.  Swap $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on $e_i$ for $1 \le i \le r-3$ and then
color $v_0v_1$ (call this edge $e_0$) with $\alpha$ and uncolor $e_{r-2}$.  Let
$\vph'$ be the resulting coloring.  Since $k \ge \Delta(G) + 1$, some color
other than $\alpha$ is missing at $v_{r-2}$; let $\gamma$ be such a color.  Now 
$v_{r-1}$ is special since $r-1$ is odd (since $P$ starts and ends with
$\alpha$), so there is an edge $e = v_{r-1}v_r$ with $\vph'(e) = \gamma$.  
Swap $\tau$ and $\alpha$ on $e_i$ for $0 \le i \le r-3$ to get a new coloring
$\vph^*$.  Now $\gamma$ and $\tau$ are both missing at $v_{r-2}$ in $\vph^*$.
Since $v_{r-1}$ is special, the fan with $v_{r-2}, v_{r-1}, v_r$ and $e$
implies that there is an edge $f_{r-1} = v_{r-1}v_r$ with $\vph^*(f_{r-1}) =
\tau$.  But we have never recolored $f_{r-1}$, so $\vph(f_{r-1})=\tau$, a
contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{ZeroNonSpecial}
Let $G$ be a non-elementary critical graph with $\chi'(G) = k+1$ for an integer $k \ge \Delta(G) + 1$.
If $(T, v_0v_1, \vph) \in \T(G)$ for some $v_0v_1 \in E(G)$, then $\nu(T) \ge 1$.
\label{lem2}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $(T, v_0v_1, \vph) \in \T(G)$ for some $v_0v_1 \in E(G)$ and $\nu(T) = 0$.
Let $\alpha \in \vphn(v_0)$ and $\beta \in \vphn(v_1)$ and put $P = P_{v_1}(\alpha, \beta)$.  Applying Lemma \ref{SpecialPath} to $P$ shows that every $\tau \in \vphn(v_0)$, 
there is a $\tau$-edge in $T$ incident to every $v \in V(P - v_0)$. By symmetry, the same is true of every $v \in V(P)$.  Hence $V(P) = V(T)$ contradicting Lemma \ref{FreeColorsLemma}.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}\label{AllSpecialImpliesElementary}
If $G$ is a critical graph in which every vertex is special, then
\[\chi'(G) \le \max \set{\ceil{\chi'_f(G)}, \Delta(G) + 1}.\]
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $G$ is a critical graph in which every vertex is special and put $k = \chi'(G) - 1$.  Then $k \ge \Delta(G) + 1$.
Since $\T(G) \ne \emptyset$, applying Lemma \ref{ZeroNonSpecial}, we conclude that $G$ is elementary.  Hence $\chi'(G) = \ceil{\chi'_f(G)}$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\section{The easy bound}
Let $G$ be a graph.  The \emph{claw-degree} of $x \in V(G)$ is 
\[\dclaw{x} \DefinedAs \max_{\substack{S \subseteq N(x) \\ \card{S} = 3}}\frac14 \parens{d(x) + \sum_{v \in S} d(v)}.\]
The \emph{claw-degree} of $G$ is 
\[\dclaw{G} \DefinedAs \max_{x \in V(G)} \dclaw{x}.\]
\begin{thm}\label{EasyBound}
If $G$ is a graph, then
\[\chi'(G) \le \max\set{\ceil{\chi'_f(G)}, \Delta(G) + 1, \ceil{\frac43\dclaw{G}}}.\]
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Suppose not and choose a counterexample $G$ minimizing $\size{G}$; note that $G$ critical. 
Let $k=\chi'(G)-1$, so $k \ge \ceil{\frac43\dclaw{G}}$. 
By Theorem \ref{AllSpecialImpliesElementary}, $G$ has a non-special vertex $x$.
Choose $xy_1 \in E(G)$ and a $k$-edge-coloring $\vph$ of $G - xy_1$ such that
$\vph$ has a fan $F$ of length $3$ rooted at $x$ with leaves $y_1, y_2, y_3$.  
Since $V(F)$ is elementary, 
\[2 + k - d(x) + \sum_{i \in \irange{3}} k-d(y_i) \le k,\]
and hence
\[\dclaw{x} \ge \frac14\parens{d(x) + \sum_{i \in \irange{3}} d(y_i)} \ge \frac{3k+2}{4}.\]
This gives the contradiction
\[\ceil{\frac43\dclaw{G}} \le k \le \frac43\dclaw{G} - \frac23.\]
\end{proof}

\section{Properties of non-special vertices}
\begin{lem}\label{OddDistanceNonSpecialsExist}
Let $G$ be a non-elementary critical graph with $\chi'(G) = k+1$ for an integer $k \ge \Delta(G) + 1$.
Let $(T, v_0v_1, \vph) \in \T(G)$. Suppose $\alpha \in \vphn(v_0)$ and $\beta \in \vphn(v_1)$ and let $P = P_{v_1}(\alpha, \beta)$.  Then there
are $a,b \in \irange{r}$ such that both $v_a, v_b$ are non-special and $b - a$ is odd.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Let $v_{i_1}, \ldots v_{i_p}$ be the non-special vertices in $P$. Suppose $i_a - i_b$ is even for all $a,b \in \irange{p}$.  
By Lemma \ref{FreeColorsLemma}, $V(P) \subsetneq V(T)$. Hence there are $j,\ell \in \irange{r}$ and $\tau \in \vphn(v_j)$ such that $\vph(v_\ell z) = \tau$ for some $z \in V(T) \setminus V(P)$.
By rotating the $\alpha-\beta$ coloring on $P$, we may assume that $j=0$.

Let $m$ be the least odd integer such that $v_m$ is non-special (if it exists, otherwise, let $m=r$).
Let $m'$ be the largest even integer such that $v_{m'}$ is non-special (if it exists, otherwise, let $m'=0$).
By Lemma \ref{SpecialPath}, there is a $\tau$-colored edge between $v_t$ and $v_{t+1}$ for all odd $t \in \irange{m-1}$.
By uncoloring $v_rv_0$, coloring $v_0v_1$ with $\beta$ and then running the same argument going the opposite direction on $P$, we conclude that 
there is a $\tau$-colored edge between $v_t$ and $v_{t+1}$ for all odd $t$ with $m' + 1 \le t \le r-1$.

But $i_a - i_b$ is even for all $a,b \in \irange{p}$, so either $m=r$ or $m'=0$.  Hence there is a $\tau$-colored edge between $v_{\ell-1} v_{\ell}$ or $v_{\ell} v_{\ell + 1}$ contradicting $\vph(v_\ell z) = \tau$.
\end{proof}

As an immediate consequence of Lemma \ref{OddDistanceNonSpecialsExist}, we get the following.

\begin{cor}\label{AtMostOneNonSpecial}
Let $G$ be a non-elementary critical graph with $\chi'(G) = k+1$ for an integer $k \ge \Delta(G) + 1$.
If $(T, v_0v_1, \vph) \in \T(G)$ for some $v_0v_1 \in E(G)$, then $\nu(T) \ge 2$.
\end{cor}

\section{Thin graphs}
Let $G$ be a critical graph with $\chi'(G) = k+1$ for an integer $k \ge \Delta(G) + 1$.
For vertices $x,y \in V(G)$, we say that $x$ is \emph{$y$-special} if every Vizing fan rooted at $x$, with respect to any $k$-edge-coloring of $G-xy$, has at most 3 vertices.
We say that $G$ is \emph{$k$-thin} if $\mu(G) < 2k - d(x) - d(y)$ for all non-special $x,y \in V(G)$.

\begin{lem}\label{HelperOne}
Let $G$ be a non-elementary critical graph with $\chi'(G) = k+1$ for an integer $k \ge \Delta(G) + 1$.
Let $\vph$ be a $k$-edge-coloring of $G-v_0v_1$.  Suppose $\alpha \in \vphn(v_0)$ and $\beta \in \vphn(v_1)$.  
Let $P = v_1v_2\cdots v_r$ be an $\alpha-\beta$ path.  Let $i,j \in \irange{r}$ with $i + 3 \le j$ such that $j-i$ is odd.  If $v_t$ is special for all $i < t < j$, then
$\mu(G) \ge 2k - d(v_i) - d(v_j)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
TODO: ADD PROOF
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{HelperFour}
Let $G$ be a non-elementary critical graph with $\chi'(G) = k+1$ for an integer $k \ge \Delta(G) + 1$.
Suppose $G$ is $k$-thin. Let $(T, v_0v_1, \vph) \in \T(G)$. Suppose $\alpha \in \vphn(v_0)$ and $\beta \in \vphn(v_1)$.  Then there are consecutive non-special vertices on $P_{v_1}(\alpha, \beta)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Put $P = P_{v_1}(\alpha, \beta)$ and let $v_{i_1}, \ldots v_{i_p}$ be the non-special vertices in $P$.
Suppose $i_{j+1} - i_j > 1$ for all $j \in \irange{p-1}$. Since $G$ is thin, Lemma \ref{HelperOne} implies that $i_{j+1} - i_j$ is even for all $j \in \irange{p-1}$.  
Hence $i_a - i_b$ is even for all $a,b \in \irange{p}$ violating Lemma \ref{OddDistanceNonSpecialsExist}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{HelperFive}
Let $G$ be a non-elementary critical graph with $\chi'(G) = k+1$ for an integer $k \ge \Delta(G) + 1$.
Suppose $G$ is $k$-thin. If $(T, e, \vph) \in \T(G)$ for $e \in E(G)$, then $\nu(T) \ge 3$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Lemma \ref{AtMostOneNonSpecial} gives $\nu(T) \ge 2$ .  Suppose $\nu(T) = 2$.  
Let $\alpha \in \vphn(v_0)$ and $\beta \in \vphn(v_1)$.  Let $P = P_{v_1}(\alpha, \beta) = v_1v_2\cdots v_rv_0$.
By Lemma \ref{HelperFour}, there is $i \in \irange{r-1}$ such that both $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ are non-special.  By rotating the $\alpha-\beta$ coloring on $P$, we may assume that $i=1$.

By Lemma \ref{FreeColorsLemma}, $V(P) \subsetneq V(T)$. Hence we have $a,b \in \irange{r}$ and $\tau \in \vphn(v_a)$ such that $\vph(v_bz) = \tau$ for some $z \in V(T) \setminus V(P)$.  
Let $Q = P_{v_b}(\tau, \beta)$. By Lemma \ref{HelperFour}, $v_1$ and $v_2$ (the only non-special vertices in $T$) must be consecutive on $Q$.  
But there cannot be a $\tau$ or $\beta$ edge between $v_1$ and $v_2$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{HelperSix}
Let $G$ be a non-elementary critical graph with $\chi'(G) = k+1$ for an integer $k \ge \Delta(G) + 1$.
Suppose $G$ is $k$-thin. If $(T, e, \vph) \in \T(G)$ for $e \in E(G)$ and $\nu(T) = 3$, then there are non-special $x_1,x_2,x_3 \in V(T)$ such that $x_ix_j \in E(G)$ and $x_i$ 
is not $x_j$-special for all $i,j \in \irange{3}$ with $i \ne j$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Choose $\alpha \in \vphn(v_0)$ and $\beta \in \vphn(v_1)$ so that the $\alpha-\beta$ path $P = v_1v_2\cdots v_rv_0$ from $v_1$ to $v_0$ so as to maximize the number of non-special vertices in $P$ and subject to that,
to maximize $|P|$.  Then $P$ contains $3$ non-special vertices since otherwise we can use the argument in Lemma \ref{HelperFive}.  By Lemma \ref{HelperFour} and symmetry we may assume that $v_a$, $v_{a+1}$ and $v_b$ are non-special where $a+1 < b$.
Now $(P, v_0v_1, \vph) \not \in \T(G)$, for otherwise $G$ would be elementary.  Hence there are $j,\ell \in \irange{r}$ and $\tau \in \vphn(v_j)$ such that $\vph(v_\ell z) = \tau$ for some $z \in V(T) \setminus V(P)$.
By rotating the $\alpha-\beta$ coloring on $P$, we may assume that $j=0$.

\claim{0}{$b > a+2$, in particular $|P| \ge 5$.}

Suppose $b = a+2$. Let $Q$ be the $\tau-\beta$ path starting at $v_\ell$.  Then $Q$ must return on a $\tau$ edge to $v_{3-\ell}$. 
But not $Q$ contains $3$ non-special vertices and $|Q| > |P|$, contradicting our maximality condition on $P$.

\claim{1}{There is a $\tau$ edge between $v_{t}$ and $v_{t+1}$ for all odd $t$ with $t < a$ or $t \ge b$.}

Immediate from Lemma \ref{SpecialPath}.

\claim{2}{$a$ is odd, $b$ is even and $a \le \ell \le b$}

By Claim 1, each $v_t$ with $t < a$ or $t > b$ is incident to a $\tau$ edge contained in $P$, so $a \le \ell \le b$.  By Lemma \ref{HelperOne}, either $b = a+2$ or $b-a$ is odd.
Suppose $a$ is even.  Then by Claim 1, $v_a$ is incident to a $\tau$ edge contained in $P$ and hence $\ell \ne a$.  Suppose $b = a+2$.



If $b$ is odd, then Lemma \ref{SpecialPath} implies that there is a $\tau$ edge between $v_{t}$ and $v_{t+1}$ for all odd $t \ge 



Let $Q = v_1z_1z_2\cdots z_mv_0$ be the $\tau-\beta$ path from $v_1$ to $v_0$.

SKETCH:  Use the fact that the $\tau-\beta$ path starting at $v_1$ must have contiguous non-special vertices to conclude that there is a $\tau$ edge from $v_2$ to $v_j$.  
Repeat the argument, now using the $\tau-\beta$ path instead of the $\alpha-\beta$ path and using $v_2$ and $v_j$ in place of $v_1$ and $v_2$.  This gets an edge from $v_j$ to $v_1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{HelperSeven}
Suppose $G$ is $k$-thin. If $(T, e, \vph) \in \T(G)$ for $e \in E(G)$ and $\nu(T) \le 4$, then there are non-special $x_1,x_2 \in V(T)$ such that $x_1x_2 \in E(G)$ and $x_1$ is not $x_2$-special.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
By Lemma \ref{HelperFive} and Lemma \ref{HelperSix} we may assume $\nu(T) = 4$. 
Choose $\alpha \in \vphn(v_0)$ and $\beta \in \vphn(v_1)$ so that the $\alpha-\beta$ path $P = v_1v_2\cdots v_rv_0$ from $v_1$ to $v_0$ so as to maximize the number of non-special vertices in $P$.
Then $P$ contains $4$ non-special vertices since otherwise we can use the arguments in Lemma \ref{HelperFive} and in Lemma \ref{HelperSix}.

By Lemma \ref{HelperFour} there are contiguous non-special vertices in $P$.  By symmetry, we may assume that $v_1$ and $v_2$ are non-special.  Let $v_a$ and $v_b$ with $2 < a < b$ be the other two non-special vertices in $P$.
Suppose $v_i$ is $v_{3-i}$-special for $i \in \irange{2}$.  

SKETCH: Look at the fans both ways, we violate thinness on either $v_0v_1$ or $v_2v_3$ depending on the parity of $b$.

\begin{thm}[from strengthening Brooks paper]\label{CriticalMuBound}
If $Q$ is the line graph of a graph $G$ and $Q$ is vertex critical, then
\[\chi(Q) \leq \max\left\{\omega(Q), \Delta(Q) + 1 - \frac{\mu(G) - 1}{2}\right\}.\]
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
If $Q$ is a line graph, then
\[\chi(Q) \le \max\set{\ceil{\chi_f(Q)}, \ceil{\epsilon(\Delta(Q) + 1)}}.\]
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Suppose the theorem is false and choose a counterexample minimizing $\card{Q}$.  Put $k = \max\set{\ceil{\chi_f(Q)}, \ceil{\epsilon(\Delta(Q) + 1)}}}}$. Say $Q = L(G)$ for a graph $G$. Then $G$ is $k$-edge-critical.

\claim{0}{Let $F$ be a fan rooted at $x$ with respect to a $k$-edge-coloring of $G - xy$.  If $|F| = 4$, then
\[d(x) < \frac{1-\epsilon}{2\epsilon -1}\sum_{v \in V(F-x)} d(v).\]}
Since $F$ is elementary, we have
\[2 + k-d(x) + \sum_{v \in V(F-x)} k - d(v) \le k,\]
so
\[2 + (|F| - 1)k \le d(x) + \sum_{v \in V(F-x)} d(v).\]
Using $k \ge \epsilon(\Delta(Q) + 1) \ge \epsilon(d(x) + d(v) - \mu(xv))$ for each $v \in V(F-x)$, we get
\[2 + \sum_{v \in V(F-x)}\epsilon(d(x) + d(v) - \mu(xv)) \le d(x) + \sum_{v \in V(F-x)} d(v),\]
so
\[2 + \parens{\epsilon|F| - 1 - \epsilon}d(x) \le \sum_{v \in V(F-x)} \epsilon\mu(xv) + \sum_{v \in V(F-x)} (1-\epsilon)d(v).\]
Now $\sum_{v \in V(F-x)} \mu(xv) \le d(x)$, so this becomes
\[2 + \parens{\epsilon|F| - 1 - 2\epsilon}d(x) \le \sum_{v \in V(F-x)} (1-\epsilon)d(v).\]
Using $|F| = 4$ gives
\[d(x) < \frac{1-\epsilon}{2\epsilon -1}\sum_{v \in V(F-x)} d(v).\]

\claim{1}{If $x \in V(G)$ with $d(x) \ge \frac{3(1-\epsilon)}{2\epsilon -1}\Delta(G)$, then $x$ is special.}

Immediate from Claim 0.

\claim{2}{If $x_1x_2 \in E(G)$ with \[d(x_i) \ge \frac{2(1-\epsilon)}{3\epsilon - 2}\Delta(G),\] for at least one $i \in \irange{2}$, then $x_1$ is $x_2$-special or $x_2$ is $x_1$-special.}

Suppose $x_1$ is not $x_2$-special and $x_2$ is not $x_1$-special.  Then by Claim 0, we have for $i \in \irange{2}$,
\[d(x_i) < \frac{1-\epsilon}{2\epsilon -1}\sum_{v \in V(F-x)} d(v) \le \frac{1-\epsilon}{2\epsilon -1}\parens{d(3-x_i) + 2\Delta(G)},\]
Solving the system gives for $i \in \irange{2}$,
\[d(x_i) < \frac{2(1-\epsilon)}{3\epsilon - 2}\Delta(G).\]

\claim{3}{If $xy \in E(G)$ with \[d(x) \ge \frac{1 - \epsilon^2}{\parens{2\epsilon - 1}^2}\Delta(G),\] then $y$ is special or $x$ is $y$-special.}

Suppose $y$ is not special and $x$ is not $y$-special.  Then by Claim 0, we have
\[d(x) < \frac{1-\epsilon}{2\epsilon -1}\sum_{v \in V(F-x)} d(v) \le \frac{1-\epsilon}{2\epsilon -1}\parens{d(y) + 2\Delta(G)},\]
Since $y$ is not special, Claim 1 gives $d(y) < \frac{3(1-\epsilon)}{2\epsilon -1}\Delta(G)$ and thus
\[d(x) < \frac{1 - \epsilon^2}{\parens{2\epsilon - 1}^2}\Delta(G).\]

\claim{4}{The theorem is true.}

Let $(T, v_0v_1, \vph) \in \T(G)$. By Lemmas \ref{HelperFive}, \ref{HelperSix} and \ref{HelperSeven} one of the following holds:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $G$ is elementary; or
\item $G$ is not thin; or
\item $\nu(T) = 3$ and $E(T)$ contains non-special $x_1,x_2,x_3 \in V(T)$ such that $x_ix_j \in E(G)$ and $x_i$ is not $x_j$-special for all $i,j \in \irange{3}$ with $i \ne j$; or
\item $\nu(T) = 4$ and $E(T)$ contains an edge $x_1x_2$ where $x_2$ is not special and $x_1$ is not $x_2$-special; or
\item $V(T)$ contains five non-special vertices $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$.
\end{enumerate}

If (1) holds, then $k + 1 = \ceil{\chi_f(Q)} \le k$, a contradiction.

If (2) holds, then by Claim 1 we have $\mu(G) \ge 2k - 2\frac{3(1-\epsilon)}{2\epsilon -1}\Delta(G)$.  Hence Theorem \ref{CriticalMuBound} gives
\[k + 1 \le \Delta(Q) + 1 - k + \frac{3(1-\epsilon)}{2\epsilon -1}\Delta(G) + \frac12,\]
so
\[2(k + 1) \le \Delta(Q) + \frac52 + \frac{3(1-\epsilon)}{2\epsilon -1}\Delta(G).\]

Since $k \ge \Delta(G) + 1$, this gives

\[k + 1 < \frac{\Delta(Q) + \frac52}{2 - \frac{3(1-\epsilon)}{2\epsilon -1}},\]
which is a contradiction when $\epsilon > \frac45$.

Suppose (3) holds.  So
\[2 + \sum_{i \in \irange{3}} k - d(x_i) \le k,\]
using Claim 2, this gives
\[3\parens{\frac{2(1-\epsilon)}{3\epsilon - 2}}\Delta(G) \ge 2k+2,\]
which is a contradiction when $\epsilon \ge \frac56$.

Suppose (4) holds.  Let $x_3,x_4$ be non-special vertices in $V(T) \setminus \set{x_1,x_2}$.
\[2 + \sum_{i \in \irange{4}} k - d(x_i) \le k,\]
using Claim 1 and Claim 3 gives
\[\parens{3\frac{3(1-\epsilon)}{2\epsilon -1} + \frac{1 - \epsilon^2}{\parens{2\epsilon - 1}^2}}\Delta(G) \ge 3k+2,\]
which is a contradiction when $\epsilon \ge \frac{39 + \sqrt{157}}{62} \approx 0.831$.

So (5) must hold.  But then
\[2 + \sum_{i \in \irange{5}} k - d(x_i) \le k,\]
using Claim 1 gives
\[\frac{15(1-\epsilon)}{2\epsilon -1}\Delta(G) \ge 4k+2,\]
which is a contradiction when $\epsilon \ge \frac{19}{23} \approx 0.826$.

\end{proof}

\section{The $\frac56$-Conjecture}
\begin{lem}
If $H$ is a connected multigraph and $G = L(H)$, then $\W(H) \le
\max\{\omega(G), 5(\Delta(G) + 1) / 6 + 3/6\}$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
%$M = |N(x)|$,
Let $d = d_H(x)$,  $\Delta = \Delta(H)$, and $h = |H|$. 
Also, let $p = \sum_{v \in N(x)} d_H(v)$ and
%Here's a way that seems a little simpler to me.  
let $t = \Delta h-2||H||$.
Note that $0 < t \le \Delta$.  Also $p \ge Md - t$.  Now summing over $N_H(x)$
gives

\begin{align*}
|N(x)|(\Delta h-t)/(h-1) > 5/6((|N(x)|-1)d + |N(x)|\Delta - t) + |N(x)|/2
\end{align*}

Solving for $|N(x)|$ gives

\begin{align*}
|N(x)| < (5d+5t)/(3+5d+5\Delta-6(\Delta h-t)/(h-1)).
\end{align*}

Since the numerator and denominator are linear in $t$, the right side is
maximized at one end of the interval $1 \le t \le D$.  Letting $t = D$,
gives $|N(x)| < (5d+5\Delta)/(3+5d-\Delta)$, like you had originally.  Letting $t = 1$,
gives $|N(x)| < (5d+5)/(3+5d+5\Delta-6(\Delta h-1)/(h-1))$, which requires a little more
analysis, akin to what you wrote in your most recent email.

Does that look right to you?



I did the analysis a little differently, but I got to the same
conclusion: Substituting $d \ge 4D/5$ gives that if $M \ge 3$, then we
must have $h \le 4$, which implies $h \le 3$, which contradicts $M \ge 3$.

So, I think I believe it.  I also agree there must be an easier way.
One thing that seems a little magical is that when $5/6 - M/(h-1) \ge 0$
all of the h's go away.

$w(H)$ really has a ceiling in its definition, not sure how much that changes
things.   without, it is the fractional chromatic index.

i think we get some gain as well from the $\Delta(H) + 2$ in place of $\Delta(H)$
we get as i wrote in the previous emails.   Maybe this helps with the ceiling.

We can use $|H|$ odd to get a bit better on the ceiling in what you wrote since the top is even (divide both by two before doing ceiling approximation).

Thinking about your comment that we can assume H is critical, we can,  but not how i was setting it up.   Probably you are already thinking something like this:

Assume Goldberg.   Take minimum counterexample to 5/6 conjecture, say 
$G = L(H)$.   The $H$ is critical.  From the argument like in strengthening of
Brooks,  we get $\chi(G) \ge \Delta(H) + 2$.  By Goldberg this implies

\begin{align*}
\chi(G) = \max_{Q \subseteq H \mbox{ s.t.$|Q|\ge 3$ and odd
}}\ceil{\frac{2||Q||}{|Q| - 1}}
\end{align*}

If the max is achieved at a proper subgraph of $H$, then there is an edge we
can remove without decreasing the max, but this decreases the chromatic number
by criticality and the max is a lower bound, so impossible. Therefore, $|H|$ is odd and

\begin{align*}
\chi(G)  =  \ceil{\frac{2||H||}{|H| - 1}}
\end{align*}

so,

\begin{align*}
\ceil{\frac{2||H||}{|H| - 1}} \ge \Delta(H) + 2
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
2||H|| / (|H| - 1) \ge \Delta(H) + 1
\end{align*}
using 
\begin{align*}
\Delta(H)|H| \ge 2||H||,
\end{align*}

using $\Delta(H)|H| \ge 2||H||$, I get

\begin{align*}
\Delta(H) \ge |H| - 1,
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

%About  the partial results.   Supposing we have the bound on w(H) to be good enough for Golberg (or at least the partial result we want to use),
%
%partial results are like
%
%\chi'(H) \le max(\Delta(H) + sqrt(\Delta(H) / 2),  ceiling(w(H)))
%
%so we can use s = sqrt(\Delta(H) / 2) in the more general bound we get from strengthening brooks (first email).

I think we should be able to prove that the conjecture follows from
Goldberg--Seymour.
That lemma you proved is pretty useful.  We can assume that H is
critical, which implies that $|N(x)| \ge 2$ for all $x$ in $H$.  Now let $J$
be the simple graph underlying $H$.  We know that $\delta(J) \ge 2$.  Let
$B = \{ x \in H s.t. d_J(x) \ge 3\}$.  That lemma implies that $|B| \le 4$.
Further, if $|B| = 4$, then each vertex of $B$ has degree 3 in $J$.  If
$|B|=3$, then two vertices of $B$ have degree 3 in $J$ and one has degree 4
in $J$.  Otherwise $|B| \le 2$.  Now if $J$ has a vertex $x$ of degree at
least 5, and $|B|=2$, then the other vertex in $B$ has degree 3 in $J$.  Now
$x$ must be a cut-vertex (since $J$ is formed by identifying one vertex in
multiple disjoint cycles, exactly one of which has a chord).  But a
cut-vertex in $J$ is also a cut-vertex in $H$, which is a contradiction.
Thus, we only need consider the cases when $|B|=3$ and $|B|=4$, which have
degree sequences $3,3,3,3,2,\ldots2$. and $4,3,3,2,\ldots,2$.
$|B|=4$ is a subdivided $K_4$ or a subdivision of a 4-cycle where one
matching has multiplicity 2.
$|B|=3$ is a subdivision of a triangulated 5-cycle.  I haven't worked
out those cases, but I don't think they should be too hard.
\newpage

\begin{lem}
\label{lem-A}
Suppose $G=L(H)$ and $G$ is a minimal counterexample to the
$\frac56$-Conjecture.  Let $k = \frac56(\Delta(G)+1)$.  If $T$ is a Tashkinov
tree w.r.t.a $k$-edge-coloring $\vph$ of $H-e$, then
\begin{align*}
\sum_{v\in V(T)}d_H(v)(5d_T(v)-6) &\le -12 + 5\sum_{e\in E(T)}\mu_H(e)
\end{align*}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Since $T$ is elementary, the sets of colors missing at vertices of $T$ are
disjoint, so $2+\sum_{v\in V(T)}(k-d_H(v))\le k$.  Rewriting this gives
$k(|V(T)|-1)\le -2 + \sum_{v\in V(T)}d_H(v)$.  
For each edge $xy\in E(T)$, we
have $k = \frac56(\Delta(G)+1)\ge \frac56(d_H(x)+d_H(y)-\mu_H(xy))$.
Summing over all $|T|-1$ edges gives
\begin{align*}
-2 + \sum_{v\in V(T)} d_H(v) &\ge k(|V(T)|-1) \\
&\ge \frac56(\Delta(G)+1)(|T|-1) \\
&\ge \frac56 \sum_{uv\in E(T)}(d_H(u)+d_H(v)-\mu_H(uv)) \\
& = \frac56\sum_{v\in V(T)}d_H(v)d_T(v)-\frac56\sum_{uv\in E(T)}\mu_H(uv)
\end{align*}

To prove the lemma, we take the first and last expressions in the inequality
chain, multiply by 6, then rearrange terms.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
If $G=L(H)$ and $G$ is a minimal counterexample to the
$\frac56$-Conjecture, then each $x\in V(H)$ is special if $d_H(x) >
\frac34\Delta(H)-3$.  
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that $x$ is a non-special vertex.  Choose $e$ incident to $x$ and a
$k$-edge-coloring $\vph$ of $G-e$ such that there exists a Vizing fan $T$
rooted at $x$ with $|T|\ge 4$.  Since every edge in $F$ is incident to $x$, we
have $\sum_{e\in E(T)}\mu_H(e)\le d_H(x)$.
From Lemma\ref{lem-A}, we have 
\begin{align*}
-12+5d_H(x) &\ge -12+5\sum_{e\in E(T)}\mu_H(e) \\
& \ge \sum_{v\in T}(5d_T(v)-6)d_H(v) \\
& \ge (5d_T(x)-6)d_H(x)+\sum_{v\in T-x}(5d_T(v)-6)d_H(v) \\
& = (5(|T|-1)-6)d_H(x)-\sum_{v\in V(T-x)}d_H(v),
\end{align*}
where the final equality holds because each vertex $v\in T-x$ is a leaf.
Now rearranging terms gives
\begin{align*}
-12 + \sum_{v\in V(T-x)}d_H(v) & \ge (5(|T|-1)-11)d_H(x)\\
-12 + (|T|-1)\Delta(H) & \ge (5(|T|-16)d_H(x)\\
d_H(x) & \le \frac{-12+(|T|-1)\Delta(H)}{5|T|-16}\\
d_H(x) & \le \frac{-12+3\Delta(H)}{4} = \frac34\Delta(H)-3,
\end{align*}
where the final inequality holds because $|T|\ge 4$ and the right side decreases
as a function of $|T|$.
\end{proof}
