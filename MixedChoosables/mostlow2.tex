\begin{abstract}
Let $G$ be a connected graph with maximum degree $\Delta$.  Brooks' theorem
states that $G$ has a $\Delta$-coloring unless $G$ is a complete graph or an
odd cycle.  A graph $G$ is \emph{degree-choosable} if $G$ can be properly
colored from its lists whenever each vertex $v$ gets a list of $d(v)$ colors.
In the context of list coloring, Brooks' theorem can be strengthened to the
following.  Every connected graph $G$ is degree-choosable unless each block of
$G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle; such a graph $G$ is a \emph{Gallai
tree}.  

This degree-choosability result was further strengthened to Alon--Tarsi orientations;
these are orientations of $G$ in which the numbers of spanning Eulerian
subgraphs with an even number of edges differs from the number with an odd
number of edges.  A graph $G$ is \emph{degree-AT} if $G$ has an Alon--Tarsi
orientation such that each vertex has indegree at least 1.  Hladky, Kral, and
Schauz showed that a connected graph is degree-AT if and only if it is not a
Gallai tree.  In this paper, we consider pairs $(G,x)$ where $G$ is a connected
graph and $x$ is some specified vertex in $V(G)$.  We characterize pairs such
that $G$ has no Alon--Tarsi orientation in which each vertex has indegree at
least 1 and $x$ has indegree at least 2.  When $G$ is 2-connected, the
characterization is simple to state.

\section{Introduction}

Brooks' theorem is one of the fundamental results in graph coloring.
For every connected graph $G$, it says that $G$ has a $\Delta$-coloring
unless $G$ is a clique $K_{\Delta+1}$ or an odd cycle.  When we seek to prove coloring
results by induction, we often want to color a subgraph $H$ where different vertices
have different lists of allowable colors (those not already used on their
neighbors in the coloring of $G-H$).  This gives rise to \emph{list coloring}.
Vizing\cite{vizing1976} and, independently, \erdos, Rubin, and
Taylor\cite{ERT} extended Brooks'
theorem to list coloring. They proved an analogue of Brooks' theorem
when each vertex $v$ has $\Delta$ allowable colors (possibly
different colors for different vertices).  
\erdos, Rubin, and Taylor\cite{ERT} and Borodin\cite{borodin1977criterion} 
strengthened this Brooks' analogue to the following result, where a
\emph{Gallai tree} is a connected graph in which each block is a clique or an
odd cycle.  

\begin{thmA}
If $G$ is connected and not a Gallai tree, then for any list assignment $L$
with $|L(v)|=d(v)$ for all $v\in V(G)$, graph $G$ has a proper coloring
$\varphi$ with $\varphi(v)\in L(v)$ for all $v$.  
\end{thmA}

The graphs in TheoremA are \emph{degree-choosable}.  It is easy to check
that every Gallai tree is not degree-choosable.  So the set of all
connected graphs that are not degree-choosable are precisely the Gallai trees.
Hladky, Kral, and Schauz\cite{HKS} extended this characterization to the setting of
Alon--Tarsi orientations.

For any digraph $D$, a spanning Eulerian subgraph is one in which each vertex
has indegree equal to outdegree.  The \emph{parity} of a spanning Eulerian
subgraph is the parity of its number of edges.  For an orientation of a graph
$G$, let EE (resp.EO) denote the number of even (resp.odd) spanning Eulerian
subgraphs.  An orientation is \emph{Alon--Tarsi} (or AT) if EE and
EO differ.  A graph $G$ is $f$-AT if it has an Alon--Tarsi
orientation $D$ such that $d^+(v)\le f(v)-1$ for each vertex $v$.  In
particular, $G$ is \emph{degree-AT} if it is $f$-AT, where $f(v)=d(v)$ for all
$v$.  
Similarly, a graph $G$ is \emph{$f$-choosable} if $G$ has a proper coloring
$\varphi$ from any list assignment $L$ such that $|L(v)|=f(v)$ for all $v\in
V(G)$.
Alon and Tarsi\cite{AlonT} used algebraic methods to prove the following
theorem for choosability.  Later, Schauz strengthened the result to
paintability, which we discuss briefly in Section\ref{sec:extensions}.
\begin{thmB}
For a graph $G$ and $\func{f}{V(G)}{\IN}$,
if $G$ is $f$-AT, then $G$ is also \emph{$f$-choosable}.
\end{thmB}

In this paper we characterize those graphs $G$ with a specified vertex $x$
that are not $f$-AT, where $f(x)=d(x)-1$ and $f(v)=d(v)$ for all other $v\in
V(G)$.  All such graphs are formed from a few 2-connected building blocks, by
repeatedly applying two operations.  Similar to that for degree-AT, our
characterization remains unchanged in the contexts of list-coloring and
paintability.  We see a sharp contrast when we consider graphs $G$ with two
specified vertices $x_1$ and $x_2$ that are not $f$-AT, where
$f(x_i)=d(x_i)-1$ for each $i\in \{1,2\}$ and $f(v)=d(v)$ for all other
$v\in V(G)$.  For Alon--Tarsi orientations, we have more than 50 exceptional
graphs on seven vertices or fewer.  Furthermore, the characterizations for
list-coloring, paintability, and Alon--Tarsi orientations all differ.

\bigskip

We consider graphs with vertices labeled by natural numbers; that is, pairs
$(G,h)$ where $G$ is a graph and $\func{h}{V(G)}{\IN}$.  We focus on the case
when $h(x)=1$ for some $x$ and $h(v)=0$ for all other $v$; we denote this
labeling as $h_x$.  We say that \emph{$(G, h)$ is AT} if $G$ is $(d_G - h)$-AT.
 When $H$ is an induced subgraph of $G$, we simplify notation by referring to
the pair $(H, h)$ when we really mean $\parens{H, h\restriction_{V(H)}}$.

Given a pair $(G,h)$ and a specified edge $e\in E(G)$, when we \emph{stretch
$e$}, we form $(G',h')$ from $(G,h)$ by subdividing $e$ twice and setting
$h'(v_i)=0$ for each of the two new vertices, $v_1$ and $v_2$ (and $h'(v)=h(v)$
for all other vertices $v$).  In Section\ref{prelims}, we prove a
\hyperref[SubdivideTwice]{Stretching Lemma}, which shows that if $(G,h)$ is not
AT and $e\in E(G)$, then stretching $e$ often yields another pair $(G',h')$
that is also not AT.  Thus, stretching plays a key role in our main result.

It is easy to check that the three pairs $(G,h)$ shown in Figure1 are not AT
(and we do this below, in Proposition\ref{prop:easyD}).  Let $\D$ be the
collection of all pairs formed from the graphs in Figure1 by stretching each
bold edge 0 or more times.  The \hyperref[SubdivideTwice]{Stretching Lemma}
implies that each pair in $\D$ is not AT.  Our main result is that these are
the only pairs $(G,h_x)$, where $G$ is 2-connected and neither a clique nor
an odd cycle, such that the $(G,h_x)$ is not AT (for some vertex $x\in V(G)$).  

\begin{mainthm}
Let $G$ be 2-connected and let $x \in V(G)$.
Now $(G,h_x)$ is AT if and only if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $d(x)=2$ and $G-x$ is not a Gallai tree; or
\item $d(x)\ge 3$, $G$ is not complete, and $(G,h_x) \not \in \D$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{mainthm}

Near the end of Section\ref{MainThmSec}, with a little more work we extend our
Main Theorem, by removing the hypothesis of 2-connectedness, to characterize
all pairs $(G,h_x)$ that are not AT.
The characterization of degree-choosable graphs have been applied
to prove a variety of graph coloring
results\cite{BohmeMS, CranstonPTV, KostochkaS, KralS, Thomassen-surface}. 
Likewise, we think our main results in this paper may be helpful in proving
other results for Alon--Tarsi orientations, such as giving better lower bounds
on the number of edges in AT-critical graphs.

To conclude this section, we show that each pair in $\D$ is not AT.
\begin{prop}
If $(G,h_x)\in \D$, then $(G,h_x)$ is not AT.
\label{prop:easyD}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
For each pair $(G,h_x)\in \D$, we construct a list assignment $L$ such that
$|L(x)|=d(x)-1$ and $|L(v)|=d(v)$ for all other $v\in V(G)$, but $G$ has no
proper coloring from $L$.  Now $(G,h_x)$ is not AT, by the contrapositive of
TheoremB.

Let $(G,h_x)$ be some stretching of the leftmost pair in Figure1. Assign the
list $\{1,2,3\}$ to each of the vertices on the unbolded triangle and assign the
list $\{1,2\}$ to each other vertex.  If $G$ has some coloring from these lists,
then vertex $x$, labeled 1 in the figure, must get color 1 or 2; by symmetry,
assume it is 1.  Along each of these paths, colors must alternate $2, 1,
\ldots$.  Each of the paths from $x$ to the triangle has odd length; thus,
color 1 is forbidden from appearing on the triangle.  So $G$ has no coloring
from $L$.  Now let $(G,h_x)$ be some stretching of the center pair in Figure1.
The proof is identical to the first case, except that each path has odd length,
so if $x$ is color 1, then color 2 is forbidden on the triangle.

Finally, consider the rightmost pair in Figure1.  Here $d(x)=4$ and $d(v)=3$
for all other $v\in V(G)$.  Thus, it suffices to show that $G$ is not
3-colorable.  Assume that $G$ has a 3-coloring and, by symmetry, assume that $x$
is colored 1.  Now colors 2 and 3 must each appear on two neighbors of $x$.
Thus, the two remaining vertices must be colored 1.  Since they are adjacent,
this is a contradiction, which proves that $G$ is not 3-colorable.
\end{proof}

\section{Subgraphs, subdivisions, and cuts}
\label{prelims}

When Hladky, Kral, and Schauz characterized degree-AT graphs, their proof relied
heavily on the observation that a connected graph $G$ is degree-AT if and only
if $G$ has some induced subgraph $H$ such that $H$ is degree-AT.  Below, we
reprove this easy lemma, and also extend it to our setting of pairs $(G,h_x)$.


\begin{lem}\label{InducedSubgraph}
Let $G$ be a connected graph and let $H$ be an induced subgraph of $G$.  If $H$
is degree-AT, then
also $G$ is degree-AT.  
Similarly, if $x\in V(H)$ and $(H,h_x)$ is AT, then also $(G,h_x)$ is AT.
Further, if $x\notin V(H)$ and $d_G(x)\ge 2$, then $(G,h_x)$ is AT.  
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that $H$ is degree-AT, and let $D'$ be an orientation of $H$ showing
this.  Extend $D'$ to an orientation $D$ of $G$ by orienting all edges away from
$H$, breaking ties arbitrarily, but consistently.  Now every directed cycle in
$D$ is also a directed cycle in $D'$ (and vice versa), so $G$ is degree-AT.
The proof of the second statement is identical.  The proof of the third
statement is similar, but now if some edge $xy$ has endpoints equidistant from
$H$, then $xy$ should be oriented into $x$.
\end{proof}

Recall that, given a pair $(G,h)$ and a specified edge $e\in E(G)$, when we
\emph{stretch $e$}, we form $(G',h')$ from $(G,h)$ by subdividing $e$ twice
and setting $h'(v_i)=0$ for each of the two new vertices, $v_1$ and $v_2$
(and $h'(v)=h(v)$ for all other vertices $v$).  By repeatedly stretching edges,
starting from the pairs in Figure1, we form all pairs $(G,h_x)$, where $G$ is
2-connected and $(G,h_x)$ is not AT.  

\begin{stretching}\label{SubdivideTwice}
Form $(G',h')$ from $(G,h)$ by stretching some edge $e\in E(G)$.
%subdividing an edge $e$ of $G$ twice and
%setting $h'(v_i)=0$ for each of the two new vertices, $v_1$ and $v_2$. 
Now
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] if $(G,h)$ is AT, then $(G', h')$ is AT; and
\item[(2)] if $(G', h')$ is AT, then either $(G,h)$ is AT or $(G-e,h)$ is AT.
\end{enumerate}	
\end{stretching}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $e = u_1u_2$ and call the new vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ so that $G'$ contains
the induced path $u_1v_1v_2u_2$.  For (1), let $D$ be an orientation of $G$ showing
that $(G,h)$ is AT. By symmetry we may assume $u_1u_2 \in E(D)$. Form an
orientation $D'$ of $G'$ from $D$ by replacing $u_1u_2$ with the directed path
$u_1v_1v_2u_2$.  We have a natural parity preserving bijection between the spanning
Eulerian subgraphs of $D$ and $D'$, so we conclude that $(G', h')$ is AT.
	
For (2), let $D'$ be an orientation of $G'$ showing that $(G',h')$ is AT. 
Suppose $G'$ contains the directed path $u_1v_1v_2u_2$ or the directed path
$u_2v_2v_1u_1$.
 By symmetry, we can assume it is $u_1v_1v_2u_2$.  Now form an orientation $D$ of
$G$ by replacing $u_1v_1v_2u_2$ with the directed edge $u_1u_2$.  As above, we have a
parity preserving bijection between the spanning Eulerian subgraphs of $D$ and
$D'$, so we conclude that $(G, h)$ is AT.  Otherwise, no spanning Eulerian
subgraph of $D'$ contains a cycle passing through $v_1$ and $v_2$.  So, the
spanning Eulerian subgraph counts of $D'$ are the same as those of $D' - v_1 -
v_2$.  However, this gives an orientation of $G-e$ showing that $(G-e, h)$ is AT.
\end{proof}

Given a pair $(G,h)$ that is not AT, the \hyperref{SubdivideTwice}[Stretching
Lemma] suggests a way to
construct a larger graph $G'$ such that $(G',h')$ is not AT.  Specifically, we
have the following.
\begin{cor}\label{SubdivideConstructor}
If $e$ is an edge in $G$ such that $(G,h)$ is not AT and $(G-e, h)$ is not AT,
then stretching $e$ gives a pair $(G',h')$ that is not AT.
%$(G',h')$ is not AT where $(G',h')$ is formed from $(G,h)$ by stretching
%$e$.
%subdividing $e$ twice and having $h'$ give zero on the two new vertices.
\end{cor}

In some cases, we can also use the \hyperref[SubdivideTwice]{Stretching Lemma} to construct a smaller graph
$\widehat{G}$ such that $(\widehat{G},h)$ is not AT.
\begin{cor}\label{ReduceP4Cor}
Let $G$ be a graph with an induced path $u_1v_1v_2u_2$ such that $d_G(v_1) =
d_G(v_2) = 2$.  If $(G,h)$ is AT, where $h(v_1) = h(v_2) = 0$, and
$(G-v_1-v_2,h)$ is not AT, then \[\parens{(G - v_1 - v_2) + u_1u_2,
h\restriction_{V(G) \setminus \set{v_1, v_2}}} \text{ is AT.}\]
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
Suppose the pair $(G,h)$ satisfies the hypotheses.
Applying part (2) of the \hyperref[SubdivideTwice]{Stretching Lemma} shows that either $\parens{G - v_1
- v_2, h\restriction_{V(G) \setminus \set{v_1, v_2}}}$ is AT or $\parens{(G -
v_1 - v_2) + u_1u_2, h\restriction_{V(G) \setminus \set{v_1, v_2}}}$ is AT. 
By hypothesis, the former is false.  Thus, the latter is true.
%But $G - x_2 - x_3$ is a proper induced subgraph of $G$, so the former cannot
%happen since $G$ is $h$-greedy-minimal and $h(x_2) = h(x_3) = 0$.  Hence
%$\parens{(G - x_2 - x_3) + x_1x_4, h\restriction_{V(G) \setminus \set{x_2,
%x_3}}}$ is AT.
\end{proof}

With standard vertex coloring, we can easily reduce to the case where $G$ is
2-connected.  If $G$ is a connected graph with two blocks, $B_1$ and $B_2$,
meeting at a cutvertex $x$, then we can color each of $B_1$ and $B_2$
independently, and afterward we can permute colorings to match at $x$.
For Alon--Tarsi orientations, the situation is not quite as simple.  However,
the following lemma plays a similar role for us.

\begin{lem}\label{CutvertexPatch}
Let $A_1, A_2 \subseteq V(G)$, and $x\in V(G)$ be such that $A_1\cup A_2=V(G)$ and $A_1 \cap
A_2 = \set{x}$.  If $G[A_i]$ is $f_i$-AT for each $i \in \{1,2\}$, then $G$ is
$f$-AT, where $f(v) = f_i(v)$ for each $v \in V(A_i-x)$ and $f(x) = f_1(x) + f_2(x)
- 1$.  Going the other direction, if $G$ is $f$-AT, then $G[A_i]$ is $f_i$-AT
for each $i \in \{1,2\}$, where $f_i(v) = f(v)$ for each $v \in V(A_i-x)$ and
$f_1(x) + f_2(x) \le f(x) + 1$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
We begin with the first statement.
For each $i \in \{1,2\}$, choose an orientation $D_i$ of $A_i$ showing that $A_i$
is $f_i$-AT.  Together these $D_i$ give an orientation $D$ of $G$. Since no cycle
has vertices in both $A_1-x$ and $A_2-x$, we have
\begin{align*}
EE(D) - EO(D) &= EE(D_1)EE(D_2) + EO(D_1)EO(D_2) - EE(D_1)EO(D_2) - EO(D_1)EE(D_2) \\
&= (EE(D_1) - EO(D_1))(EE(D_2) - EO(D_2)) \\
&\ne 0.
\end{align*}
Hence $G$ is $f$-AT.
	
Now we prove the second statement.  Suppose that $G$ is $f$-AT and choose an
orientation $D$ of $G$ showing this. 
Let $D_i = D[A_i]$ for each $i \in \{1,2\}$.  As above, we have $0 \ne
EE(D) - EO(D) = (EE(D_1) - EO(D_1))(EE(D_2) - EO(D_2))$. Hence, $EE(D_1) -
EO(D_1) \ne 0$ and $EE(D_2) - EO(D_2) \ne 0$.  Since the indegree of $x$ in
$D$ is the sum of the indegree of $x$ in $D_1$ and the indegree of $x$ in
$D_2$, the lemma follows.
\end{proof}

\section{Degree-AT graphs and an Extension Lemma}
%A graph $G$ is called \emph{degree-AT} if $(G,h)$ is $AT$ where $h(v)=0$ for all
%$v\in V(G)$.
Recall that our Main Theorem relies on a characterization of degree-AT graphs. 
As we mentioned in the introduction, a description of degree-choosable graphs
was first given by Borodin\cite{borodin1977criterion} and \erdos, Rubin, and
Taylor\cite{ERT}.  Hladky, Kral, and Schauz\cite{HKS} later extended the
proof from\cite{ERT} to Alon--Tarsi orientations.  This proof relies on
Rubin's Block lemma, which states that every 2-connected graph $G$ contains an
induced even cycle with at most one chord, unless $G$ is a clique or an odd
cycle.  For variety, and completeness, we include a new proof; it extends ideas
of Kostochka, Stiebitz, and Wirth\cite{KSW} from list-coloring to Alon--Tarsi
orientations.  For this proof we need the following very special case of a key
lemma in \cite{OreVizing}.  When vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent, we write
$x\adj y$; otherwise $x\nonadj y$.

\begin{lem}\label{GeneralEulerLemma}
Let $G$ be a graph and $x \in V(G)$ such that $H$ is connected, where $H \DefinedAs G-x$. 
If there exist $z_1, z_2 \in V(H)$ with $N_H[z_1] = N_H[z_2]$ such that $x \adj
z_1$ and $x \nonadj z_2$, then $G$ is $f$-AT where $f(x) = 2$ and $f(v) =
d_G(v)$ for all $v \in V(H)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Order the vertices of $H$ with $z_1$ first and $z_2$ second so that every
vertex, other than $z_1$, has at least one neighbor preceding it. 
Orient each edge of $H$ from its earlier endpoint toward its later endpoint. 
Orient $xz_1$ into $z_1$ and orient all other
edges incident to $x$ into $x$.  Let $D$ be the resulting orientation. 
Clearly, $d_{D}^+(v) \le f(v) - 1$ for all $v \in V(D)$.  So, we just need to
check that $EE(D) \ne EO(D)$.  

Since $xz_1$ is the only edge of $D$ leaving
$x$, and $D-x$ is acyclic, every spanning Eulerian subgraph of $D$ that has
edges must have edge $xz_1$.  
%
Consider an Eulerian subgraph $A$ of $D$ containing $xz_1$. Since $z_1$ %must
has indegree $1$ in $A$, it must also have outdegree $1$ in $A$.  We show
that $A$ has a mate $A'$ of opposite parity.  
%
If $z_2 \in A$ then $z_1z_2w \in A$, for some $w$, so we form
$A'$ from $A$ by removing $z_1z_2w$ and adding $z_1w$. 
If instead $z_1z_2\notin A$, then $z_2 \not \in A$ and $z_1w \in
A$ for some $w \in N_H[z_1]-z_2$, so we form $A'$ from $A$ by removing $z_1w$ and
adding $z_1z_2w$.  
%
Hence exactly half of the Eulerian subgraphs of $D$ that contain edges are
even.  Since the edgeless spanning subgraph of $D$ is an even Eulerian
subgraph, we conclude that $EE(D) = EO(D) + 1$.  Hence $G$ is $f$-AT.
\end{proof}

We use the previous lemma to give a new proof of the characterization of
degree-AT graphs.
\begin{lem}
\label{DegreeATClassification}
A connected graph $G$ is degree-AT if it is not a Gallai tree.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose there exists a connected graph that is not a Gallai tree, but is also not
degree-AT.  Let $G$ be such a graph with as few vertices as possible.
Since $G$ is not degree-AT, no induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ is
degree-AT by the \hyperref[InducedSubgraph]{Subgraph Lemma}. 
Hence, for any $v \in V(G)$ that is not a cutvertex, $G-v$ must be a Gallai
tree by minimality of $|G|$.  
	
If $G$ has more than one block, then for endblocks $B_1$ and $B_2$, choose
noncutvertices $w\in B_1$ and $x\in B_2$.  By the minimality of $|G|$, both
$G-w$ and $G-x$ are Gallai trees.  Since every block of $G$ appears either as a
block of $G-w$ or as a block of $G-x$, every block of $G$ is either complete or
an odd cycle.  Hence, $G$ is a Gallai tree, a contradiction.  So instead $G$
has only one block, that is, $G$ is $2$-connected.  Further, $G-v$ is a Gallai
tree for all $v \in V(G)$.
	
Let $v$ be a vertex of minimum degree in $G$.  Since $G$ is $2$-connected,
$d_G(v) \ge 2$ and $v$ is adjacent to a noncutvertex in every endblock of $G-v$.
If $G-v$ has a complete block $B$ with noncutvertices $x_1,x_2$ where $v \adj
x_1$ and $v \nonadj x_2$, then we can apply Lemma \ref{GeneralEulerLemma} 
%with $Y = \set{v}$ and $F = vx_1$ 
to conclude that $G$ is degree-AT, a
contradiction.  So, $v$ must be adjacent to every noncutvertex in every
complete endblock of $G-v$.
	
Suppose $d_G(v) \ge 3$.  Now no endblock of $G-v$ can be an odd cycle of
length at least $5$ ($G$ would have vertices of degree $3$ and also $d_G(v) \ge
4$, contradicting the minimality of $d_G(v)$).  Let $B$ be a smallest complete
endblock of $G-v$.  Now for a noncutvertex $x \in V(B)$, we have $d_G(x) =
|B|$ and hence $d_G(v) \le |B|$. 
If $G-v$ has at least two endblocks, then $2(|B|-1) \le |B|$, so $d_G(v)
\le |B| = 2$, a contradiction.  Hence, $G-v = B$ and $v$ is joined to $B$, so
$G$ is complete, which is a contradiction.
	
Thus, we have $d_G(v) = 2$.  Suppose $G-v$ has at least two endblocks. 
Now it has exactly two and $v$ is adjacent to one noncutvertex in each. 
Neither of the endblocks can be odd cycles of length at least five, since then
we can get a smaller counterexample by the \hyperref[SubdivideTwice]{Stretching
Lemma}.  Since $v$ is adjacent to every noncutvertex in every
complete endblock of $G-v$, both endblocks must be $K_2$.  But now either
$G=C_4$ (which is trivially degree-AT) or we can get a smaller counterexample
by the \hyperref[SubdivideTwice]{Stretching Lemma}.  So, $G-v$ must be
$2$-connected. Since $G-v$ is a Gallai tree, it is either complete or an odd
cycle.  If $G-v$ is not complete, then we can get a smaller counterexample by
the \hyperref[SubdivideTwice]{Stretching Lemma}.  So, $G-v$ is complete and
$v$ is adjacent to every
noncutvertex of $G-v$; that is, $G$ is complete, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\section{When h is 1 for at most one vertex}
\label{MainThmSec}
For a graph $G$ and $x \in V(G)$ recall that $\func{h_x}{V(G)}{\IN}$ is defined
as $h_x(x) = 1$ and $h_x(v) = 0$ for all $v \in V(G-x)$. We classify the
connected 
graphs $G$ such that $(G,h_x)$ is AT for some $x \in V(G)$. 
%To start, we reduce to the case when $G$ is $2$-connected.
We begin with the case when $G$ is 2-connected, which takes most of the work.
At the end of the section, we extend this to all connected graphs.

We will show that for most 2-connected graphs $G$ and vertices $x\in V(G)$, the
pair $(G,h_x)$ is AT.  Specifically, this is true for all pairs except those in
$\D$, defined in the introduction.  In view of the
\hyperref[InducedSubgraph]{Subgraph Lemma}, for
a 2-connected graph $G$ and $x\in V(G)$, to show $(G,h_x)$ is AT it suffices to
find some induced subgraph $H$, with $x\in V(H)$, such that $(H,h_x)$ is AT. 
The subgraphs $H$ that we consider all have $d_H(x)\ge 3$.  This motivates the
next lemma, which allows us to reduce to the case $d_G(x)\ge 3$.

\begin{lem}\label{DegreeTwoVertex}
If $G$ is a connected graph and $x \in V(G)$ with $d_G(x) = 2$, then $(G,h_x)$
is AT if and only if $G-x$ is degree-AT.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Let $D$ be an orientation of $G$ showing that $(G,h_x)$ is AT.  Then
$d_{D}^-(x) = 2$ and hence no spanning Eulerian subgraph contains a cycle
passing through $x$.  Therefore, the Eulerian subgraph counts in $G-x$ are
different and $G-x$ is degree-AT.  The other direction is immediate from the
\hyperref[InducedSubgraph]{Subgraph Lemma}
\end{proof}

A \emph{$\theta$-graph}, $\Theta_{a,b,c}$, consists of two vertices joined by
three internally disjoint paths, with lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$.  We will see
shortly that if $H$ is a $\theta$-graph with $d_H(x)=3$, then $(H,h_x)$ is AT.
Thus, we can assume that $G$ has no induced $\theta$-graph $H$ with $d_H(x)=3$. 
All of the other
forbidden subgraphs $H$ that we consider (and show that $(H,h_x)$ is AT) can be
viewed as $\theta$-graphs with at most three extra edges.  We show if $G$ is
2-connected with $x\in V(G)$ and $d(x)\ge 3$, then either (i) $G\in \D$ or (ii)
$G$ contains one of these forbidden ``nearly $\theta$-' graphs.

\begin{lem}
\label{ThetaReducible}
\label{TgraphReducible}
\label{T+graphReducible}
The pair $(G,h_x)$ is AT whenever (i) $G$ is a $\theta$-graph, (ii) $G$ is a
$T$-graph and two paths $P_i$ have lengths of opposite parities, or (iii) $G$ is
formed from a $T$-graph by adding an extra vertex with neighborhood
$\{z_1,z_2,z_3\}$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
In each case, we give an AT orientation $D$ of $G$ such that $d_D^-(v)\ge
h_x(v)+1$ for each $v\in V(G)$.

Case (i).  Orient the edges of each path $P_i$ consistently, with $P_1$ and
$P_2$ into $x$ and $P_3$ out of $x$; this orientation satisfies the degree
requirements.  Further, it has exactly three spanning Eulerian subgraphs,
including the empty subgraph.  Thus, $EE+EO$ is odd, so $EE\ne EO$.

Case (ii).  Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be two paths with opposite parities.  As before,
orient the edges of each path consistently, with $P_1$ and $P_2$ into $x$ and
$P_3$ out of $x$.  Orient the three additional edges as $\vec{z_1z_2},
\vec{z_2z_3}$, and $\vec{z_3z_1}$.  The resulting digraph $D$ has four spanning
Eulerian subgraphs, 3 of one parity and 1 of the other.  Note that the empty
subgraph and the subgraph $\{\vec{z_1z_2}, \vec{z_2z_3}, \vec{z_3z_1}\}$ have
opposite parities.  Further, the parities are the same for the two subgraphs
consisting of the directed cycles $xP_3z_3z_1P_1$ and $xP_3z_3z_1z_2P_2$.  So,
$EE\ne EO$.

Case (iii).  The simplest instance of this case is when $G=K_5-e$.  Now
$(G,h_x)$ is AT by Lemma\ref{CutvertexPatch}.  In fact, that proof gives the
stronger statement that there exists an orientation $D$ satisfying the degree
requirements such that $EE(D)=EO(D)+1$.  In particular, $EE+EO$ is odd.
To handle larger instances of this case, we repeatedly subdivide edges incident
to $x$ and orient each of the resulting paths consistently, and in the direction
of the corresponding edge in $D$.  The resulting orientation satisfies the
degree requirements.  Further, the sum $EE+EO$ remains unchanged, and thus odd.
 Hence, still $EE\ne EO$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{AddPathReducible}
Let $G$ be a $T$-graph. Let $P$ be a path of $G$ where all internal
vertices of $P$ have degree 2 in $G$ and one endvertex of $P$ has degree 2 in
$G$.  Form $G'$ from $G$ by adding a path $P'$ (of length at least 2) joining
the endvertices of $P$.  Now $(G', h_x)$ is AT.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
We can assume that $G$ is not AT; otherwise, we are done by Lemma 2.1.
By symmetry, assume $P$ is a subpath $P_3$. First, we get an orientation of $G$
with indegree at least 1 for all vertices and $d^-(x) = 2$. Orient $P_1$
from $z_1$ to $x$, $P_2$ from $z_2$ to $x$, $P_3$ from $x$ to $z_3$, and the triangle
as $z_3z_2$, $z_3z_1$, $z_1z_2$.  To get an orientation of $G'$, orient the
new path $P'$ consistently, and opposite of $P$.  Now the only
directed cycle containing edges of $P'$ is $P'P$.  Since the Eulerian subgraph
counts are equal for $G$, they differ by 1 for $G'$. 
\end{proof}

\input{pics}

\begin{lem}\label{TwoConnectedClassification}
Let $G$ be 2-connected, and choose $x\in V(G)$ with $d(x)\ge 3$. 
Now $(G,h_x)$ is AT if and only if $G$ is not complete and $(G,h_x) \not \in \D$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
First suppose that $(G,h_x)\in \D$.  Add details.

Now let $G$ be 2-connected, choose $x\in V(G)$ with $d(x)\ge 3$, and suppose that
$(G,h_x)\notin \D$.  Since $G-x$ is connected, let $H'$ be a smallest connected
subgraph of $G-x$ containing three neighbors of $x$; call these neighbors $w$,
$y$, and $z$.  Consider a spanning tree $T$ of $H'$.  Since $H'$ is minimum,
each leaf of $T$ is among $\{w, y, z\}$.  If $T$ is a path, then $H'$ is also a
path.  Otherwise, $T$ is a subdivision of $K_{1,3}$.  Let $s$ be the vertex with
$d_T(s)=3$.  If $E(G)-E(T)$ has any edge with both ends outside of $N(s)$, then
we can delete some vertex in $N(s)$ and remain connected, contradicting the
minimality of $H'$.  Similarly, if $N(s)$ contains at least two edges, then
$H'-s$ still connects, $w$, $y$, and $z$.  Now let $H$ be the subgraph of $G$
induced by $V(H')\cup\{x\}$.  Note that $H$ is either a $\theta$-graph (if $H'$
is a tree) or a $T$-graph (if $H'$ has one extra edge in $N(s)$).  

If $H$ is a $\theta$-graph, then $(G,h_x)$ is AT, by
Lemma\ref{ThetaReducible} and 
the \hyperref[InducedSubgraph]{Subgraph Lemma}.
So assume $H$ is a $T$-graph.  Let $z_1$, $z_2$, $z_3$ be the vertices
of degree 3 (other than $x$), and let $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ denote the paths
from $x$ to $z_1$, $z_2$, and $z_3$; when we write $V(P_i)$, we exclude $x$ and
$z_i$, so possibly $V(P_i)$ is empty for one or more $i\in\{1,2,3\}$.
If any two of $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ have lengths with opposite parities, then
we are done by Lemma\ref{TgraphReducible}; so assume not.  
	
Now $(H,h_x)\in \D$, so we can assume that $V(G-H) \ne \emptyset$.  Choose $u
\in V(G-H)$, and let $H_u$ be a minimal $2$-connected induced subgraph of $G$
that contains $V(H) \cup \set{u}$.  By the \hyperref[InducedSubgraph]{Subgraph
Lemma} and Lemma\ref{DegreeATClassification}, $G-x$ is a Gallai tree. 
Thus, so is $H_u-x$; in particular, the block $B_u$ of $H_u-x$ containing $u$
is complete or an odd cycle.  Therefore, we either have (i) $V(B_u) \cap V(H) =
\set{z_1, z_2,z_3}$ or (ii)  $V(B_u) \cap V(H) \subseteq P_i \cup \set{z_i}$
for some $i \in \{1,2,3\}$.
	
Suppose (i) happens. Now $N_G(u) \cap V(H_u - x) = \set{z_1,z_2,z_3}$. If $x
\nonadj u$, then $(G,h_x)$ is AT by the \hyperref[InducedSubgraph]{Subgraph
Lemma} and Lemma\ref{T+graphReducible}.  If $x \adj u$, then $x$ must have odd
length paths to each $z_i$, by Lemma\ref{TgraphReducible}, with $u$ in the role
of some $z_i$.  Further, $x \adj z_i$ for all $i \in \{1,2,3\}$, since
otherwise $(G,h_x)$ is AT by the
\hyperref[InducedSubgraph]{Subgraph Lemma}, Lemma\ref{T+graphReducible}, and
the \hyperref[SubdivideTwice]{Stretching Lemma}.  So, $H=K_4$ and $H_u$ is
$K_5$.  This implies that (ii) cannot happen for any vertex in $V(G-H)$ (if
$V(B_u)\cap V(H)=\{z_i\}$ for some $i$, then $(G,h_x)$ is AT by
Lemma\ref{ThetaReducible} 
and the \hyperref[IndudcedSubgraph]{Subgraph Lemma}).
So (i) happens for every vertex in $V(G-H)$; in particular, $V(G-H)$ is joined
to $\set{x,z_1,z_2,z_3}$.  Since $G$ is not complete, it must contain an induced
copy of Figure\ref{fig:K5minus}; hence, $(G,h_x)$ is AT by the
\hyperref[InducedSubgraph]{Subgraph Lemma}.
		
Assume instead that (ii) happens for every vertex in $V(G-H)$. Pick $u \in V(G
- H)$. By symmetry, assume that $V(B_u) \cap V(H) \subseteq P_1$.  Let $z_1P_1
= v_1v_2\cdots v_{\ell}$, where $v_{\ell}\adj x$.  First, assume that $B_u$ is
an odd cycle of length at least $5$.  If there is $u' \in V(B_u)\setminus V(H)$
with $u' \adj x$, then $G$ contains a $\theta$-graph and  $(G,h_x)$ is AT, by
Lemma\ref{ThetaReducible} and \hyperref[InducedSubgraph]{Subgraph Lemma}.  So,
we may assume that $u' \nonadj x$ for all $u' \in V(B_u)\setminus V(H)$.  Now
we are done by Lemma\ref{AddPathReducible} and the
\hyperref[InducedSubgraph]{Subgraph Lemma}.

So, we may assume that $B_u$ is complete. If $V(B_u) \cap V(H)=\set{v_\ell}$,
then $G$ has an induced $\theta$-graph $J$, where $d_J(x)=d_J(v_\ell)=3$, so we are
done by Lemma\ref{ThetaReducible} and the \hyperref[IndudcedSubgraph]{Subgraph
Lemma}.  Thus, we must have $V(B_u) \cap V(H) = \set{v_{j},
v_{j+1}}$ for some $j \in \irange{\ell}$.  In particular, $B_u$ is a triangle. 
If $j \ne \ell - 1$, then $u\nonadj x$, by the minimality of $H$;
so $(G,h_x)$ is AT by the
\hyperref[InducedSubgraph]{Subgraph Lemma} and Lemma\ref{AddPathReducible}.
%Figure\ref{fig:WingedCows} or Figure\ref{fig:thebiggerones}.  
Thus, we conclude that $u\adj x$, so $j=\ell-1$.  
%By Lemma \ref{GeneralEulerLemma}, $(G,h_x)$ is AT unless $x \adj u$. 
Hence, $H_u$ is formed from $T$-graph by adding a vertex $u$ added that is
adjacent to $x$ and to the vertices of a $K_2$ endblock $D_u$ of $H-x$. 
%
Suppose there are distinct vertices $u_1, u_2\in V(G-H)$ such that $D_{u_1} =
D_{u_2}$.  Now $G$ contains an induced copy of Figure \ref{fig:K5minus}(b), so 
$(G,h_x)$ is AT by Lemma\ref{T+graphReducible} and the
\hyperref[InducedSubgraph]{Subgraph Lemma}.  Thus, each $K_2$ endblock has at
most one such $u$.  

Let $t$ be the number of $K_2$ endblocks in $H-x$.
By construction, $t\le 3$; this implies that $|V(G - H)| \le t$.   
If $t = 0$, then $G = H = K_4$, which contradicts that $G$ is not complete.  
If $t=1$, then $G = H_u$ is the Moser spindle, for the unique $u \in V(G-H)$. 
So, assume that $t \in \set{2,3}$.  
Now %$G$ has an induced subgraph
the subgraph induced by $\set{u}\cup V(H-P_1)$  
%that 
is reducible by Lemma\ref{AddPathReducible}. %specifically, this is 
So, again we are done by the
\hyperref[InducedSubgraph]{Subgraph Lemma}.  
\end{proof}


\begin{thm}
If $G$ is connected and $x \in V(G)$, then $(G, h_x)$ is not AT if and only if
\end{thm}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] $d(x) = 1$; or
\item[(2)] $G$ is a Gallai tree; or
\item[(3)] $d(x) = 2$ and $G-x$ has a component that is a Gallai tree; or
\item[(4)] $x$ is a cutvertex, all but at most one $x$-lobe of G is a Gallai
tree and for every $x$-lobe $H$ of $G$, we have $(G, h_x)$ is not AT; or
\item[(5)] $x$ is not a cutvertex and for the block $B$ of $G$ containing $x$,
we have $(B,h_x) \in \D$ and all $B$-lobes of $G$ are Gallai trees.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
First, lets check that if any of (1)--(5) happen, then $(G, h_x)$ is not AT.  1 and 2
are immediate.  3 follows from Lemma 4.2. 4 follows from Lemma 2.2. 5 follows
from Lemma 4.9 and Lemma 2.2.

Now, for the other direction, suppose $(G, h_x)$ is not AT and none of
(1)--(5) happen.  By Lemma 4.2 (and not 1 and not 3) we must have $d(x) \ge 3$. 
Suppose $x$ is a cutvertex.  Then (by not 4), at least two $x$-lobes of $G$ are
not Gallai trees or $(H, h_x)$ is AT for some $x$-lobe $H$ of $G$.  But then
$(G,h_x)$ is AT by Lemma 2.2, a contradiction.  So, $x$ is not a cutvertex. 
Suppose the block $B$ of $G$ containing $x$ is complete or $(B,h_x) \in \D$. 
Now (by not 2 and not 5) some $B$-lobe $H$ of $G$ is not a Gallai tree.  Since
$G-x$ is connected, we conclude that $G-x$ is degree-AT and by directing all
edges incident to $x$ into $x$, we get that $(G,h_x)$ is AT, a contradiction. 
By Lemma 2.2, we know that $(B, h_x)$ is not AT. Since B is 2-connected, the
argument in the Lemma in the last email
shows that B is \textbf{$h_x$-minimal}.  We just learned that $B$ is not
complete and $(B,h_x) \not \in \D$, so applying Lemma 4.9 shows that $(B, h_x)$
is AT, a contradiction.

%A graph $G$ is \emph{$h$-minimal} if $G$ is connected and $\parens{H, h}$ is
%not AT for every proper induced subgraph $H$ of $G$.  A graph $G$ is
%\emph{$h$-greedy-minimal} if $G$ is connected and $\parens{H, h}$ is not AT for
%every proper induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ where $h(v) = 0$ for all $v \in V(G)
%\setminus V(H)$. Note that if $G$ is $h$-minimal then it is also $h$-greedy-minimal.

%\begin{lem}\label{TwoConnectedReduction}
%	Let $G$ be $h_x$-minimal for $x \in V(G)$ and let $\B$ be the set of
%blocks of $G$ containing $x$.  Now $(G,h_x)$ is AT if and only if
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item $\B$ contains at least two degree-AT graphs; or
%		\item $G$ is $2$-connected and $(G, h_x)$ is AT.
%	\end{enumerate}
%\end{lem}
%\begin{proof}
%	Since $G$ is $h_x$-minimal, no block outside of $\B$ is degree-AT.  The lemma
%follows since if $G$ is not $2$-connected, then $(G,h_x)$ is AT if and only if
%(1) holds by Lemma \ref{CutvertexPatch}.

\section{Choosability and Paintability}
\label{sec:extensions}
As we mentioned in the introduction, Alon and Tarsi showed that if a graph $G$
is $f$-AT, then $G$ is also $f$-choosable.  \emph{Online list coloring}, also
called \emph{painting} is similar to list coloring, but now the list for each
vertex is progressively revealed, as the graph is colored. 
Schauz\cite{schauz2010flexible} extended the Alon--Tarsi theorem, to show that
if $G$ is $f$-AT, then $G$ is also $f$-paintable.  In this section, we use our
characterization of pairs $(G,h_x)$ that are not AT to prove characterizations
of pairs $(G,h_x)$ that are not paintable and that are not choosable.  More
precisely, a pair $(G,h_x)$ is \emph{choosable} if $G$ has a proper coloring
from its lists $L$ whenever $L$ is such that $|L(x)|=d(x)-1$ and $|L(v)|=d(v)$
for all other $v$; otherwise $(G,h_x)$ is \emph{not choosable}.  The definition
of a pair being paintable is analogous.  We characterize all pairs $(G,h_x)$,
where $G$ is connected and $(G,h_x)$ is not choosable (resp. paintable).  We
will see that, in fact, these characterizations (for both choosability and
paintability) are identical to that for pairs that are not AT.  

For completeness, we include the following definition of $f$-paintable.
Schauz gave a more intuitive (yet equivalent) definition, in terms of a two
player game.  We say that $G$ is \emph{$f$-paintable} if either (i) $G$ is
empty or (ii) $f(v) \ge 1$ for all $v \in V(G)$ and for every $S \subseteq
V(G)$ there is an independent set $I \subseteq S$ such that $G-I$ is
$f'$-paintable where $f'(v) \DefinedAs f(v)$ for $v \in V(G) - S$ and $f'(v)
\DefinedAs f(v) - 1$ for $v \in S - I$.

Since all pairs $(G,h_x)$ that are AT are also both paintable and choosable, it
suffices to show that every pair $(G,h_x)$ that is not AT is also not choosable
(here we use that if a pair is paintable, then it is also choosable).

\begin{thm}
For every connected graph $G$, the pair $(G,h_x)$ is not choosable if and only
if $(G,h_x)$ is not AT.  Thus, the same characterization holds for pairs that
are not paintable.
\end{thm}

Also, show that when we move up to two vertices $x,y$ with $h(x) =
h(y) = 1$, AT, choosability and paintability all
separate.

%\section{Applications}
%When this is in a critical graph, we get $h_x$-minimality for free.  If $x$ has
%$t \ge 5$ neighbors in one component of the low vertex subgraph, then those
%neighbors are all in one $K_t$ block.  If $t = 4$, then the neighbors are
%either a $K_4$ block or we create the Moser
%Spindle.
