\begin{lem}
	The graph in Figure \ref{fig:b860e768-7266-42fa-9d05-3beefaf3786e} is reducible.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}Let $X = \{0,1\}$, $Y = \{0,2\}$ and $Z = \{1,2\}$. Then with the vertex ordering in Figure \ref{fig:b860e768-7266-42fa-9d05-3beefaf3786e}, a string such as ZXYXXX, 
	represents a possible list assignment on $V(H)$ arising from a $3$-edge-coloring of $G-E(H)$.
	By an $X$-Kempe change, we mean flipping colors $0$ and $1$ on a two-colored path in $G-E(H)$.  We call such a path an $X$-path. 
	Any endpoint of an $X$-path in $H$ must end at a $Y$ or $Z$ vertex.  The meanings of $Y$-Kempe change, $Z$-Kempe change, $Y$-path and $Z$-path are analogous.
	Note that if there are an odd number of $Y$'s and $Z$'s, then at least one $X$-Kempe change has only one endpoint in $H$.
	
	We need to handle all boards that are nearly colorable for edge $e$ up to permutations of $\{X,Y,Z\}$, so it will suffice to handle all boards of the form $\wild Z\wild \wild YZ$, $\wild \wild \wild YYZ$, $Y\wild \wild \wild YZ$, $X\wild \wild YZZ$, $Z\wild \wild YZZ$, $X\wild \wild ZYZ$, $Z\wild \wild XYZ$, $X\wild YZZZ$, $Y\wild YZZZ$, $YY\wild YZZ$, $YX\wild YZZ$, $XYZZZZ$, $YYZZZZ$, $YZZZZZ$, $ZZZZZZ$ or $ZZYZZZ$.
	
	\case{1}{$B$ is one of $\wild Z\wild \wild YZ$, $\wild Y\wild YZZ$, $\wild X\wild YZZ$, $\wild \wild ZYYZ$, $\wild \wild XYYZ$, $Y\wild Y\wild YZ$, $\wild ZYZZZ$, $X\wild ZZYZ$, $X\wild XZYZ$, $Y\wild YZZZ$, $Y\wild ZZYZ$, $Y\wild XXYZ$, $Z\wild ZXYZ$, $Z\wild XXYZ$, $XYZZZZ$, $XZYYZZ$, $XZXYZZ$, $YYZZZZ$, $ZZZZZZ$, $ZZZYZZ$ or $ZZYYZZ$.}
	In all these cases, $H$ is immediately colorable from the lists.
	
	\case{2}{$B$ is one of $XYY\wild YZ$, $XXYXYZ$, $XXYZYZ$, $XZZYZZ$, $XYYZZZ$, $YZZYZZ$, $YYXZYZ$, $YZZZZZ$, $ZYYZZZ$, $ZYZZYZ$, $ZYYYYZ$, $ZYXZYZ$, $ZXYZYZ$, $ZXZZYZ$, $ZXYZZZ$, $ZXYYYZ$ or $ZYZZZZ$.}
	
	
	For YZZZZZ, if the Y-path starting at the third vertex doesn't end in $H$ or ends at the fourth, fifth or sixth vertex of $H$, then doing a Y-Kempe change there yields XZYZZZ, XZYYZZ, XZYZYZ and XYZYYZ respectively, which are handled by Case 1.
	If the Y-path starting at the fifth vertex doesn't end in $H$ or ends at the fourth or sixth vertex of $H$, then doing a Y-Kempe change there yields XZZZYZ, XZZYYZ and XYYYZZ respectively, which are handled by Case 1.
	If the Y-path starting at the second vertex doesn't end in $H$ then doing a Y-Kempe change there yields XYZZZZ, which is handled by Case 1.
	Since we already handled the permutation of all resulting boards by (2 1 4 3 6 5), we have also handled ZYZZZZ.
	
	
	For XYYZZZ, if the X-path starting at the third vertex doesn't end in $H$ or ends at the fourth or sixth vertex of $H$, then doing an X-Kempe change there yields XYZZZZ, XYZYZZ and XZYYYZ respectively, which are handled by Case 1.
	If the X-path starting at the fourth vertex doesn't end in $H$ or ends at the sixth vertex of $H$, then doing an X-Kempe change there yields XYYYZZ and XZZZYZ respectively, which are handled by Case 1.
	If the X-path starting at the second vertex doesn't end in $H$ then doing an X-Kempe change there yields XZYZZZ, which is handled by Case 1.
	If the X-path starting at the sixth vertex doesn't end in $H$ then doing an X-Kempe change there yields XZZYYZ, which is handled by Case 1.
	Since we already handled the permutation of all resulting boards by (2 1 6 3 4 5), we have also handled ZXYYYZ.
	
	
	For XZZYZZ, if the X-path starting at the third vertex doesn't end in $H$ or ends at the second, fourth, fifth or sixth vertex of $H$, then doing an X-Kempe change there yields XZYYZZ, XYYYZZ, XZYZZZ, XZYYYZ and XYZZYZ respectively, which are handled by Case 1.
	If the X-path starting at the fifth vertex doesn't end in $H$ or ends at the fourth vertex of $H$, then doing an X-Kempe change there yields XZZYYZ and XZZZYZ respectively, which are handled by Case 1.
	If the X-path starting at the second vertex doesn't end in $H$ then doing an X-Kempe change there yields XYZYZZ, which is handled by Case 1.
	Since we already handled the permutation of all resulting boards by (1 2 3 6 5 4), (2 1 6 3 4 5) and (2 1 6 5 4 3), we have also handled XYYYYZ, ZXYZZZ and ZXZZYZ.
	
	
	For XYYZYZ, if the X-path starting at the third vertex doesn't end in $H$ or ends at the second, fourth, fifth or sixth vertex of $H$, then doing an X-Kempe change there yields XYZZYZ, XZZZYZ, XYZYYZ, XYZZZZ and XZYYZZ respectively, which are handled by Case 1.
	If the X-path starting at the second vertex doesn't end in $H$ then doing an X-Kempe change there yields XZYZYZ, which is handled by Case 1.
	If the X-path starting at the fifth vertex ends at the fourth or sixth vertex of $H$, then doing an X-Kempe change there yields XYYYZZ and XZZYYZ respectively, which are handled by Case 1.
	Since we already handled the permutation of all resulting boards by (2 1 6 3 4 5), we have also handled ZXYZYZ.
	
	
	For XXYZYZ, if the X-path starting at the fourth vertex ends at the fifth or sixth vertex of $H$, then doing an X-Kempe change there yields XXYYZZ and YYZZZZ respectively, which are handled by Case 1.
	If the X-path starting at the fifth vertex ends at the sixth vertex of $H$, then doing an X-Kempe change there yields XXZYYZ, which is handled by Case 1.
	
	For YYXZYZ, if the X-path starting at the fourth vertex doesn't end in $H$ or ends at the second, fifth or sixth vertex of $H$, then doing an X-Kempe change there yields YYXYYZ, YZXYYZ, YYXYZZ and ZZYZZZ respectively, which are handled by Case 1.
	If the X-path starting at the second vertex doesn't end in $H$ or ends at the fifth or sixth vertex of $H$, then doing an X-Kempe change there yields YZXZYZ, XZYZZZ and ZYXYZZ respectively, which are handled by Case 1.
	If the X-path starting at the fifth vertex ends at the sixth vertex of $H$, then doing an X-Kempe change there yields ZZXYYZ, which is handled by Case 1.
	Since we already handled the permutation of all resulting boards by (1 4 3 2 6 5), (2 1 6 5 4 3) and (2 5 6 1 3 4), we have also handled ZYXZYZ, XXYXYZ and XYYXYZ.
	
	
	For ZYYYYZ, if the X-path starting at the third vertex ends at the second, fifth or sixth vertex of $H$, then doing an X-Kempe change there yields ZZZYYZ, ZYZYZZ and YZYZZZ respectively, which are handled by Case 1.
	If the X-path starting at the fifth vertex ends at the second or sixth vertex of $H$, then doing an X-Kempe change there yields ZZYYZZ and YZZZYZ respectively, which are handled by Case 1.
	If the X-path starting at the second vertex ends at the sixth vertex of $H$, then doing an X-Kempe change there yields YYZZZZ, which is handled by Case 1.
	Since we already handled the permutation of all resulting boards by (1 2 3 6 5 4), (2 1 4 3 6 5) and (2 1 4 5 6 3), we have also handled YZZYZZ, ZYZZYZ and ZYYZZZ.
	
	
	\case{3}{$B$ is one of $XYXXYZ$, $XYZXYZ$, $XXXXYZ$, $XXZXYZ$, $XXYYYZ$, $XXYZZZ$, $YZXYZZ$, $YXXZYZ$, $YYZXYZ$, $ZXXZYZ$, $ZYYXYZ$, $ZXYXYZ$ or $ZZXYZZ$.}
	
	Since XXYZZZ has an odd number of X's and Y's, there is a Z-path with exactly one end in $H$.
	If this is the first, second or third vertex of $H$, then doing a Z-Kempe change there yields YXYZZZ, XYYZZZ and YYYZZZ respectively, which are handled by Cases 1 and 2.
	Since we already handled the permutation of all resulting boards by (1 2 6 3 4 5), (3 6 4 1 2 5) and (3 6 5 1 2 4), we have also handled XXYYYZ, YYZXYZ and XXZXYZ.
	
	
	For YXXZYZ, if the Z-path starting at the second vertex ends at the third or fifth vertex of $H$, then doing a Z-Kempe change there yields YYYZYZ and XXYZYZ respectively, which are handled by Cases 1 and 2.
	If the Z-path starting at the third vertex ends at the fifth vertex of $H$, then doing a Z-Kempe change there yields XYXZYZ, which is handled by Case 1.

	For ZYYXYZ, if the Z-path starting at the third vertex ends at the fourth or fifth vertex of $H$, then doing a Z-Kempe change there yields ZYXYYZ and ZXYYYZ respectively, which are handled by Cases 1 and 2.
	If the Z-path starting at the fourth vertex ends at the fifth vertex of $H$, then doing a Z-Kempe change there yields ZXXXYZ, which is handled by Case 1.
	Since we already handled the permutation of all resulting boards by (1 2 5 3 6 4), (2 1 3 6 4 5) and (2 1 4 5 6 3), we have also handled YZXYZZ, XYXXYZ and ZXXZYZ.
	
	
	For ZZXYZZ, if the Y-path starting at the third vertex doesn't end in $H$ or ends at the first, second or fifth vertex of $H$, then doing a Y-Kempe change there yields ZZZYZZ, XZZYZZ, ZXZYZZ and ZZZXYZ respectively, which are handled by Cases 1 and 2.
	If the Y-path starting at the first vertex doesn't end in $H$ then doing a Y-Kempe change there yields XZXYZZ, which is handled by Case 1.

	\case{4}{$B$ is one of $YXZXYZ$.}
