\mydesc{ My cofounders and I formed LBD Data to build a suite of enterprise software products in collaboration with Safety Vision, a producer of mobile video solutions for police and public transit. Our products are used throughout the United States. TODO: How many installations, how many users, how much video stored (TB). I was the sole developer on a team of 3.}

\squishlist
	\item Designed and developed SafetyView, an application to search and explore large video collections for the purposes of identifying video clips and submitting them into evidence for legal proceedings (\CS{}).
		\squishlist
		        \item UI to search and sort through videos with previews (\CS{}, WinForms).
                         \item GPU-accelerated 180$^\circ$ fisheye camera dewarping with support for tilt/pan/zoom.
		        \item Video player (H264/MPEG4) with support for 16 channels plus integrated UI that presents all relevant metadata including GPS traces, allowing you to scrub through the video based on, e.g. location (libavcodec, OpenStreetMap).
		        \item Video editor with support for annotation and blurring faces (OpenCV).
			\item Shareable, permissioned web links to specific videos (Amazon S3, Cloudfront, DynamoDB).
			\item HTML5 Mobile App for viewing streams with synchronized multichannel playback.
		\squishend
		
	\item Developed SafetyNet, a media server to collect video from a fleet of vehicles and support search and playback in SafetyView. It also monitors and reports on the health of the underlying Camera/DVR hardware (\CS{}).
		\squishlist
			\item High speed multithreaded video import, including scraping GPS and vehicle metadata from a variety of file formats and storing it in a central database (\CS{}, MS-SQL)
			\item Automatic wireless download of video from vehicles with support for resume (FTP/SFTP/SSH/Samba/ other custom protocols).
			\item Wireless Camera/DVR health analysis (camera functioning/positioning/field of view) 
			\item Management of software/firmware upgrades for Camera/DVR hardware for the whole fleet.
			\item Video search backend for SafetyView (SQL).
			\item Streaming video to SafetyView.
		\squishend
		
	\item Created LiveLook, a realtime web-based UI for public transit systems that allows centralized monitoring and alerting for fleets of thousands of vehicles, including simultaneous viewing of the video streams from their onboard cameras. (\CC{} / \CS{} / JavaScript / HTML / CSS)
		\squishlist
			\item Live playback of multiple IP camera streams. (JavaScript / HTML)
                         \item Map UI for monitoring vehicle locations with sub-second latency (built on top of Google Maps).
			\item Uses LIVE555 to eat the streams, passing frames up to a \CS{} WPF viewer.
			\item J1939 implementation (\CC{}) for retrieving vehicle diagnostics, including ECU and tire pressure.

	\item Wrote significant portions of Goldman Sachs' (the parent company) new \CS{} financial plotting tool.
	\item Built our charting framework, including a re-usable API used by all other developers and the core chart rendering service, using vector graphics. This generates thumbnail charts for web pages as well as creating complete stock and research reports. Topological sort was to used to  avoid label collisions (\CS{}, WPF).

\begin{quote}
This article is about coloring countries on a map so that adjacent countries receive distinct colors.  It was conjectured
in 1852 that any map could be colored thusly using only 4 colors.  This was finally proved in 1976, but the proof is not human-checkable;
it requires many hours of computer time to check thousands of cases.  Finding a human-checkable proof is still an open problem.
To prove that 5 colors suffice is relatively simple.  We gave a human-checkable proof that 4.5 colors suffice; this means that
we get to use 9 colors, but have to assign each country 2 colors.

\begin{quote}
Three gods A, B, and C are called, in no particular order, True, False, and Random. 
True always speaks truly, False always speaks falsely, but whether Random speaks truly or falsely is a completely random matter. 
Your task is to determine the identities of A, B, and C by asking three yes-no questions; each question must be put to exactly one god. 
The gods understand English, but will answer all questions in their own language, in which the words for yes and no are da and ja, in some order. 
You do not know which word means which.
	  \squishlist
		\item Showed how to trivialize the puzzle by asking questions that elicit meaningful answers from Random.
		\item Showed how to solve the puzzle in only two questions by using paradoxes to explode god-heads.
		\item This article led to the problem getting a lot of \href{http://brianrabern.net/New_Scientist_HLPE.pdf}{\color{blue}{press}}
