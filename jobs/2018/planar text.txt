This article is about coloring countries on a map so that adjacent countries receive distinct colors. It was conjectured in 1852 that any map could be colored thusly using only 4 colors. This was finally proved in 1976, but the proof is not human-checkable; it requires many hours of computer time to check thousands of cases. Finding a human-checkable proof is still an open problem. To prove that 5 colors suce is relatively simple. We gave a human-checkable proof that 4.5 colors suffice; this means that we get to use 9 colors, but have to assign each country 2 colors.

*Settled a 20-year old conjecture on the existence of such a proof.
